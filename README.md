## Spectrum and Data Growth
- Data Growth (2017-2025): Exponential increase in mobile data, reaching a 1122% growth by 2025.
- Spectrum Deficit: Significant shortage of cellular spectrum, with a deficit of 853 MHz by 2025.
- Spectrum Sensing: Various detection methods (Energy, Cyclostationary, Eigenvalue etc) for managing spectrum use.
- Cooperative Spectrum Sensing: Involves multiple secondary users and a centralized data fusion center for efficient spectrum management.
- Implementation: Focus on algorithms and devices for effective spectrum sensing and data transmission.

## Energy Detection Technique
- How it Works: Measures the energy level of the received signal over a specific bandwidth to determine the presence of a primary user.
- Low Power Consumption: Emphasis on designing circuits that minimize power usage while maintaining performance, crucial for battery-operated devices in cognitive radio networks.

**Energy Detection Formula:**

The energy detection method determines the presence of a signal by measuring its energy.
$E = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2$
Where:
* $E$ is the energy of the signal.
* $x[n]$ is the received signal.
* $N$ is the number of samples.
