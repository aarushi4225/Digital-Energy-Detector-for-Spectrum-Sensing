# Digital Energy Detector for Spectrum Sensing

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a high-speed digital energy detector module designed for efficient spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks. The project focuses on a hardware-based solution for real-time signal detection.

### Important Concepts

* **Cognitive Radio (CR):** A smart radio system that detects available channels in the wireless spectrum and adapts its transmission parameters.
* **Spectrum Sensing:** The process of detecting unused frequency bands (spectrum holes) to enable opportunistic access for secondary users.
* **Energy Detection:** A spectrum sensing technique that measures the energy level of a received signal to infer the presence of a primary user.

### System Overview
The core of this project is a digital energy detector that measures the energy of a received signal. The system architecture is designed to be efficient and fast, which is critical for real-time spectrum sensing.

The energy ($E$) of the signal is calculated using the following formula:

$E = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} |x[n]|^2$

Where:
* $E$ is the energy of the signal.
* $x[n]$ is the received signal.
* $N$ is the number of samples.

### Implementation Features

The Verilog module implements a robust and configurable energy detection architecture with the following features:

* **Fixed-Point Arithmetic:** A custom MATLAB script is used to convert floating-point signals into a fixed-point representation suitable for hardware implementation.
* **High-Throughput Processing:** A dedicated multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit computes the instantaneous energy for each complex input sample.
* **Accumulation Unit:** A dedicated accumulator gathers energy over a configurable number of samples to improve detection accuracy.
* **Threshold Comparison:** A comparator continuously checks the accumulated energy against a configurable threshold value.
* **Detection Flag:** A flag is asserted when the accumulated energy exceeds the threshold, indicating the potential presence of a primary user.

This hardware-centric approach provides the high performance required for real-time spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems.
